##Kakfa Streaming
Kafka streaming is a client library developed by Confluent that abstracts away a lot of the nitty gritty details
of writing streaming applications. Per the Kafka documentation, "A stream is an ordered, replayable,
and fault-tolerant sequence of immutable data records". A stream has a source, from which
messages are read and a sink, into which data is written. In terms of Kafka, both of these are topics.
