## Kafka Producer
Kafka producer picks partition to send records (messages) to topics based on the recordâ€™s key.
Producer writes do not guarantee the order of records across partitions.
 * Load balancing
     * Producer sends data directly to the broker (leader for partition)
      * To enable this  all nodes could answer which servers are alive and where leaders for the partitions of a top are at any given time
 * Producer controls which partition it publishes message to by
   * Random load balancing:  efficiently distributing incoming network traffic across a group of backend servers
   * Semantic partitioning function: user could specify key to partition and use this to hash to partition to ensures locality sensitive processing
* Asynchronous send
   * Batching  enabled because Kafka producer attempt to accumulate data in. Memory and send out larger batches in a single request
   * Configurable buffering gives a fair tradeoff of sacrificing a small bit of latency for improving actual throughput
